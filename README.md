Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

Passionate about Data Science, Analytics, Business Intelligence, Agrobusiness and Julia Language.

I am graduated in Analysis and Systems Development (Precision Agriculture as extra subject). Twice awarded: as best undergraduate student and outstanding undergraduate final project award.

Currently I work as IT Trainee at an agricultural multinational, where I am responsible for projects in data analysis and process automation, working with ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazil-China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ teams.
I'm the first Continuous Improvement representative in the Information Technology department.

I firmly believe that I can change agriculture and people's lives, using technology as a tool for results and innovation that will be a legacy for future generations.

<h4> My Agribusiness Passion ðŸŒ±ðŸšœ </h4>
Most of my projects are in the agribusiness/agriculture area, where I always try to do data science projects with the aim of improving the food production chain.

<h4>Language Preferences</h4>
<p>I decided to learn Julia language to do my job as a Data Scientist and it became my favorite. Being part of a community still in formation with innovative projects and being able to contribute to this is something that motivates me and is part of the essence of language.</p>
