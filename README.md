# ‚≠ê Highlighted Projects:

## ü´ò Grain Variance Coefficient
The tool takes an image of grains as input, identify individual grains and calculate the width and height of each grain.
The tool also calculates the coefficient of variance for the widths and heights, providing a measure of the variability of grain size. The results are visualized directly on the image, with each grain enclosed in a rectangle and the dimensions displayed.

## üåΩ CornSeed XRay Infestation Detection
This project uses computer vision with YOLO to detect and classify infested corn seeds (with larvae, holes, or other internal damage) from X-ray images. The goal is to automate seed screening and quality control in agricultural and lab environments.
- It detects individual seeds in X-ray images.
- Classify each seed as:
  - `infested` (presence of larvae, holes, etc.)
  - `not_infested` (normal)
- Improve accuracy in automated seed screening for agriculture.

## üöõ Trucks Queue
Truck Queue is a computer vision project that leverages a YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to monitor and count parked trucks almost in real-time. This tool was developed to optimize the logistics and loading process at industrial facilities by providing a clear view of the truck queue outside the company.

## üè¨ Distributors Clustering
This project aims to cluster the distributors of a company based on their sales data. The company has a large number of distributors and wants to group them into different clusters based on their sales data. The company wants to understand the characteristics of each cluster and use this information to make decisions about how to better support each distributor.
