Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

Passionate about Data Science, Business Intelligence, Agrobusiness and developing solutions with R.

Studying at the MBA in Data Science and Analytics at USP / ESALQ.

I am graduated in Analysis and Systems Development (Precision Agriculture as extra subject). Twice awarded: as best undergraduate student and outstanding undergraduate final project award.

I firmly believe that I can change agriculture and people's lives, using technology as a tool for results and innovation that will be a legacy for future generations.
