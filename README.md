## Highlighted Projects:

<details>
<summary><b>AgRag</b></summary>
 <br>
This project implements a Q&A system using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technique, based on a PDF file with technical content (such as questions and answers about a crop).
 
```
Main features:
 ✅ Everything local and free (no cloud or paid API)
 ✅ Semantic indexing of the content of an Embrapa PDF
 ✅ Contextualized answers, in Portuguese, about agronomic practices
 ✅ 100% focus on real data about the chosen crop
```

 <summary><b>Revela - LLM AI Agents for Devotionals</b></summary>
<br>
Revela is an AI-powered system that generates devotionals based on specific themes. Using a crew of specialized AI agents, Revela researches relevant Bible passages, provides theological analysis, and crafts structured spiritual messages.
<br><br>
 
**Input theme**: "patience" 
<br>
[Devotional Output](https://github.com/josehenriqueroveda/revela/blob/main/devotional-2025-05-09.md)

**Features:**
 ```
- Bible Research Agent: Locates precise scripture passages based on references or thematic keywords
- Theological Analyst: Provides deep historical, literary, and spiritual interpretation of passages
- Devotional Writer: Crafts well-structured, Christ-centered messages for spiritual edification
- Local LLM Support: Works with local models via Ollama (default: Gemma 3 1B)
- Bible Search Tool: Efficiently searches through scripture with both reference and keyword lookup
 ```

<summary><b>AI Market Intelligence Agent</b></summary>
 <br>
This solution uses CrewAI, Gemini and LangChain with DuckDuckGo to automate grain market analysis.
 
The aim is to save time and turn dispersed data into strategic data in a few minutes.

The output is a market intelligence report containing the following topics: 
 
```
1. Executive summary
2. Sector overview, 
3. Opportunities and threats
4. Actionable moves
```

<summary><b>Grain Variance Coefficient</b></summary>
<br>
The tool takes an image of grains as input, identify individual grains and calculate the width and height of each grain.
The tool also calculates the coefficient of variance for the widths and heights, providing a measure of the variability of grain size. The results are visualized directly on the image, with each grain enclosed in a rectangle and the dimensions displayed.

<summary><b>CornSeed XRay Infestation Detection</b></summary>
<br>
This project uses computer vision with YOLO to detect and classify infested corn seeds (with larvae, holes, or other internal damage) from X-ray images. The goal is to automate seed screening and quality control in agricultural and lab environments.
- It detects individual seeds in X-ray images.
- Classify each seed as:
  - `infested` (presence of larvae, holes, etc.)
  - `not_infested` (normal)
- Improve accuracy in automated seed screening for agriculture.

<summary><b>Trucks Queue</b></summary>
<br>
Truck Queue is a computer vision project that leverages a YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to monitor and count parked trucks almost in real-time. This tool was developed to optimize the logistics and loading process at industrial facilities by providing a clear view of the truck queue outside the company.

<summary><b>Pollen Grain Detection</b></summary>
<br>
This project uses a YOLOv11 model to identify and classify pollen grains in microscopy images.
Given a set of microscope images, the script performs:
- Automatic detection of pollen grains.
- Counting the number of grains for each identified class.
- Generation of a CSV report (results.csv) with the count of each pollen type per image.

<summary><b>Distributors Clustering</b></summary>
<br>
This project aims to cluster the distributors of a company based on their sales data. The company has a large number of distributors and wants to group them into different clusters based on their sales data. The company wants to understand the characteristics of each cluster and use this information to make decisions about how to better support each distributor.
