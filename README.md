Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

Passionate about Data Science, Business Intelligence, Agrobusiness and R.

I am graduated in Analysis and Systems Development (Precision Agriculture as extra subject). Twice awarded: as best undergraduate student and outstanding undergraduate final project award.

Currently I work as IT Trainee at an agricultural multinational, where I am responsible for projects in data analysis and process automation, working with Brazil-China teams.
I'm the first Continuous Improvement representative in the Information Technology department.

I firmly believe that I can change agriculture and people's lives, using technology as a tool for results and innovation that will be a legacy for future generations.
